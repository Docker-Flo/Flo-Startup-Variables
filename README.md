# Flo-Startup-Variables
This should be added to the panel under a Service, For this exmaple it is a sub option of the minecraft service, it will automatically generate the `start.sh` file inside the server and we be ready for action!

**Make sure** to also update the Docker container to `thefonix/flo` (which can be found --> [Here](https://github.com/TheFonix/Docker-Flo/blob/master/DockerfileHere) <--) as this has all of the dependencies for the flo startup system to work.
